# SDA-EEG-Group-Project
Scientific Data Analysis Group Project

- The CSD_matrix scrypt provides the "cross_spectral_matrix" & "average_csd" used in "Test2_Procedure.ipynb" & "CSD_Global_Visualization.ipynb"

- Running the MNE_Visualization script will first display the RAW EEG (Voltage Vs Time) of a "healthy" patient and then the Power Spectral Density Curve of that same patient. When the windows are closed, it will show you the same curves for a "schizophrenic" patient. For the Voltage Vs Time Curves showing all channels, pressing "-" and "+" on your keyboard will scale down or up the signal for better visualisation. It is also specified in the help tab of that plot.

- The "CSD_Global_Visualization" Notebook, will display the CSD Matrices & Difference Matrices from our dataset, for both groups and for all types of waves. It will also show you a mapping of the channels for better understanding the content of the Matrices.

- The Test2_Procedure Notebook will walk you through the 2nd statistical analysis procedure we performed to assess how significant are the CSD differences between both groups (healthy & diagnosed schizophrenic groups)
